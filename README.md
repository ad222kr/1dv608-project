#1dv608 - Project
Repository for the project in the course Web development with php

##Vision
The vision for this project was to create an application that can list the sortiment of beers for the different pubs in Kalmar and their prices, since it's not that fun to got to the same pub and drink the same bland "stor stark" every friday night.
The idea was that users could comment on the beers/pubs and leave a rating and maybe upload pictures of their beers, but as of now only an administration can add beers/pubs (since I'm ppretty time optimistic).

##Use cases

###Use case 1 - View Pubs
Main
1. User navigates to the page.
2. System presents a list of pubs
3. User chooses a pub to view from the list
4. System presents the pub to the user
Alternate 1A
1. User navigates to the page via a bookmark
2. The pub is no longer in the system
3. System presents an error page
4. User navigates back to the fron-page, does step 1 in Main
